# Cancer-Detection-and-Model-interpretability-using-SHAP-and-LIME
This project addresess a medical problem of detecting cancer and understanding what causes cancer in body using machine learning.
Prediction of cancer is done using Xgboost classifier where accurcay of 89% is achieved after hyperparameter tuning using gridsearchcv. Later model interpretability is explained using Lime and Sharp tools. 

Dataset used in the project is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
